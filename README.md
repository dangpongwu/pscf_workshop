# UMN pscf workshop
This repository has files needed for the SCFT workshop at the University of Minnesota on August 24, 2024. You can download this repository to your computer by clicking on the green "Code" button near the top of the page and choosing to download as a zip. You can also clone the repository into a working directory at MSI. In generally, cloning is better than downloading because it allows easy updating when any files are changed. But cloning is not necessary for this workshop.

The directories that are named after phases include the pscfpp example files that we will use in the workshop. You do not need to do anything with these files to get started, but you may want to take a look at them. The readme files within the directories have some instructions that will be useful for the workshop. They are easier to read on github versus in the .md file (which can be opened in a text editor). 

The folder "polymer_visual" is a copy of the Matlab program at https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual that we use for visualization of the density fields.

There is also a file WorkshopDay1.pdf that is a scanned version of the notes from the first day of the workshop. 

The workshop will use pscf as installed on MSI. The documentation for pscf is located at https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man/.

We will use the Dashboard interface at MSI for running the calculations. Information for this tool is available at https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/using-open-ondemand. To access the actual tool, the link is https://ondemand.msi.umn.edu/. You will need ot log-in using your x500 username and password. If you are not on campus, you also need to be connected by vpn.
