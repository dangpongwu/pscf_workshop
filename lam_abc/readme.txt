Converting diblock LAM solution to triblock

1. grow diblock LAM to triblock LAM with [f_A, f_B, f_C] = [0.5, 0.49, 0.01]
	- convert initial guesses by running python script
	- edit 'param' file: monomer, chi, block length, ...
	- edit 'command' file
	- run  

2. sweep triblock LAM with [f_A, f_B, f_C] = [0.5, 0.49, 0.01] to [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
	- add sweep to 'param'
	- edit 'command'
	- run
